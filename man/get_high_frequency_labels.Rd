\title{Get High Frequency Labels with Value Pairs}
\usage{
get_high_frequency_labels(x, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A labelled vector (e.g., from haven::read_sav) to be analyzed.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. If >= 1, it's treated as an absolute count. If < 1, it's treated as a proportion of non-NA values in x.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{kv_pairs}{A named vector of value-label pairs for high-frequency labels}
  \item{freq}{A named vector of frequencies for high-frequency labels}
  \item{json}{A JSON string representation of the value-label pairs}
}
\description{
This function identifies high-frequency labels in a vector and returns associated value-label pairs.
}
\details{
The function first calls `tabulate_high_frequency_labels` to identify labels meeting the threshold.
It then extracts the value-label pairs for these high-frequency labels from the input vector.
The result includes both the value-label pairs and their frequencies, as well as a JSON representation of the pairs.

\examples{
library(haven)
values <- c("AL", "AT", "AL", "BE", "AT", "AL", "BE", NA)
labels <- c("Albania" = "AL", "Austria" = "AT", "Belgium" = "BE")
x <- haven::labelled(values, labels)
get_high_frequency_labels(x, threshold = 2)
